1. Roor Mean Square Error - RMSE
</summary>
A Typical performance measure for rgression problem is the root mean square error(RMSE). <br />
It gives an idea of how uch eror the system typically makes in its prediction

2. Mean Absolute error - MAE
</summary>
IF there are many outliers you might consider using MAE( also called average absolute deviation).
</details>
Note: RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than MAE. But when Outlirs are exponentially rare the RMSE performs very well and is preferred.
