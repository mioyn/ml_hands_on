Roor Mean Square Error - RMSE
</summary>
A Typical performance measure for rgression problem is the root mean square error(RMSE). <br />
It gives an idea of how uch eror the system typically makes in its prediction

<summary>
Mean Absolute error - MAE
</summary>
IF there are many outliers you might consider using MAE( also called average absolute deviation).
</details>
Note: RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than MAE. But when Outlirs are exponentially rare the RMSE performs very well and is preferred.

If trainng accuracy is very high and validation accuracy is very low then it means  then its a over trained model
