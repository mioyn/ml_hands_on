### Logical Flow of SQL Query Execution in PostgreSQL
| Step   | Clause           | What happens                              |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | `FROM`           | Selects the source tables and joins them. |
| **2**  | `ON`             | Applies join conditions (if joins exist). |
| **3**  | `JOIN`           | Combines rows from multiple tables.       |
| **4**  | `WHERE`          | Filters rows *before* grouping.           |
| **5**  | `GROUP BY`       | Groups rows into buckets.                 |
| **6**  | `HAVING`         | Filters groups created by GROUP BY.       |
| **7**  | `SELECT`         | Selects columns and expressions.          |
| **8**  | `DISTINCT`       | Removes duplicates (after SELECT).        |
| **9**  | `ORDER BY`       | Sorts the results.                        |
| **10** | `LIMIT / OFFSET` | Returns only a subset of rows.            |
